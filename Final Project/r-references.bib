@article{werner2009,
	abstract = {The apparent revival of non-consensual bride abduction in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan is somewhat surprising seventy years after the Soviet state banned the practice and introduced sweeping legislation to emancipate women. This article relies on local discourses of shame and tradition to explain changing marriage practices and to mark a shift towards greater patriarchy in post-Soviet Central Asia. Discourses of shame are mobilized by local actors in support of the popular view that a woman should 'stay' after being abducted. Women can and do resist abductions, but they risk dealing with the burden of shame. Further, in Kyrgyzstan, where bride abduction is increasingly re-imagined as a national tradition, women and activists who challenge this practice can be viewed as traitors to their ethnicity. In post-Soviet society, these discourses of shame and tradition have helped men assert further control over female mobility and female sexuality. /// Le renouveau des enl{\`e}vements non consentis de femmes au Kazakhstan et au Kirghizstan peut surprendre, soixante-dix ans apr{\`e}s l'interdiction de cette pratique par l'{\'E}tat sovi{\'e}tique et la mise en place d'une l{\'e}gislation volontariste pour l'{\'e}mancipation des femmes. Sur la base des discours locaux sur la honte et la tradition, l'article explique ce changement de pratiques matrimoniales et met en lumi{\`e}re la r{\'e}surgence du patriarcat en Asie centrale postsovi{\'e}tique. Les discours sur la honte sont mobilis{\'e}s par les acteurs locaux {\`a} l'appui de l'id{\'e}e populaire qu'une femme doit "rester" apr{\`e}s avoir {\'e}t{\'e} enlev{\'e}e. Les femmes peuvent r{\'e}sister aux enl{\`e}vements, et r{\'e}sistent effectivement, mais s'exposent ainsi au poids de la honte. Par ailleurs, au Kirghizstan, o{\`u} le rapt des femmes est de plus en plus r{\'e}-imagin{\'e} comme une tradition nationale, les femmes et les militants qui contestent cette pratique peuvent {\^e}tre accus{\'e}s de trahison envers leurs racines ethniques. Ces discours sur la honte et la tradition ont aid{\'e} les hommes {\`a} reprendre le contr{\^o}le de la mobilit{\'e} et de la sexualit{\'e} des femmes dans la soci{\'e}t{\'e} postsovi{\'e}tique.},

            2004 - 
            In Kyrgyzstan, it is not unusual for a girl to go to school carefree in the morning, but to end up a bride in a family of strangers by nightfall. It is no use to put up a struggle. Young Kairgul is calmly waiting for the school bus. She does not suspect that the man hanging out on the curb has evil intentions, but the next moment, he pushes her into a passing car and kidnaps her to become his bride. \&ldquo;I don't want to be late for school,\&rdquo; she shouts. \&ldquo;Your classes are over,\&rdquo; he dryly responds. In Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia, men abduct a bride if they are not rich enough to pay a dowry. The kidnapping is often discussed beforehand in the potential groom's family: who has a car available, what the girl should be able to do, and where she will live. After the abduction, the new in-laws inform the girl\&rsquo;s parents, who often accept the \&ldquo;proposal.\&rdquo; Kidnapping a bride is the usual state of affairs. \&ldquo;We have all been abducted,\&rdquo; women tell a freshly kidnapped girl who reluctantly stands in a corner. Director Petr Lom films the brides, the grooms and the in-laws, and tells the story from this remote country in five chapters. By the way, the native men wear nice hats.},

              gram sabhas
              , or village assemblies, of rural India. Drawing on normative theories of deliberation, we identify empirical standards for ``good'' deliberation based on one's ability both to speak and to be heard, and use natural language processing methods to generate these measures. We first show that, even in the rural Indian context, these assemblies are not mere ``talking shops,'' but rather provide opportunities for citizens to challenge their elected officials, demand transparency, and provide information about local development needs. Second, we find that women are at a disadvantage relative to men; they are less likely to speak, set the agenda, and receive a relevant response from state officials. And finally, we show that quotas for women for village presidencies improve the likelihood that female citizens are heard.},

@article{cleuziou2016,
	abstract = {This article introduces a thematic issue consisting of five articles, which analyze the complex interrelations between gender norms and representations and the construction of nationalism in the post-Soviet republics of Central Asia. Drawing from gender and feminist studies, the first section explores how Central Asian nationalisms have promoted hierarchized gender roles to reinforce their legitimacy, noticeably invoking the authority of ``tradition.'' The second section examines not only how the Soviet period continues to shape contemporary nation-building processes in the region, but also how the latter has been creating new historical references to emancipate them from the Soviet legacy - and from the Soviet policy toward women in particular. The third section examines how gender norms promoted by Central Asian states may affect women in their everyday life and how they may negotiate, refuse, or promote these norms. In the final section, we show how ``gender equality'' has become a watchword of international organizations' agendas and we analyze the production and implementation of this international agenda setting in a specific national context.},

@book{jonesluong2018,
	abstract = {With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, former Communist Party leaders in Central Asia were faced with the daunting task of building states where they previously had not existed: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Their task was complicated by the institutional and ideological legacy of the Soviet system as well as by a more actively engaged international community. These nascent states inherited a set of institutions that included bloated bureaucracies, centralized economic planning, and patronage networks. Some of these institutions survived, others have mutated, and new institutions have been created. Experts on Central Asia here examine the emerging relationship between state actors and social forces in the region. Through the prism of local institutions, the authors reassess both our understanding of Central Asia and of the state-building process more broadly. They scrutinize a wide array of institutional actors, ranging from regional governments and neighborhood committees to transnational and non-governmental organizations. With original empirical research and theoretical insight, the volume's contributors illuminate an obscure but resource-rich and strategically significant region.},
